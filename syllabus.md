# Syllabus - Stated Preference Survey Research for Transportation

**Instructor:** Mahbub Hassan  
**Affiliation:** Non Asean Scholar, Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand  
**Email:** [mahbub.hassan@ieee.org](mailto:mahbub.hassan@ieee.org) | [6870376421@student.chula.ac.th](mailto:6870376421@student.chula.ac.th)

## Course description
This graduate-level short course equips transportation professionals with the theory and practice of stated preference (SP) survey design, implementation, and modeling. Learners work through a complete SP lifecycle-from concept framing and experimental design to field deployment, discrete choice modeling, and policy storytelling.

## Learning outcomes
By the end of the course, participants will be able to:
1. Distinguish SP approaches from revealed preference data and defend when to use each.
2. Formulate research objectives, target populations, and experiment-friendly attributes/levels.
3. Construct efficient choice task designs using orthogonal and Bayesian techniques.
4. Plan, pilot, and execute SP fieldwork ethically with reproducible documentation.
5. Estimate logit-family models, interpret parameters, elasticity measures, and heterogeneity.
6. Communicate findings for decision-makers via scenario analysis and policy memos.

## Recommended pacing
| Module | Title | Focus | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Foundations of SP Methods | Concepts, benefit cases, utility theory refresh | Reflection memo |
| 2 | Survey Design Essentials | Attribute selection, questionnaire structure, stakeholder review | Design brief |
| 3 | Experimental Design & Choice Tasks | Orthogonal vs efficient designs, software demos | Efficient design package |
| 4 | Implementation & Fieldwork | Sampling, pilots, ethics, metadata | Pilot & recruitment plan |
| 5 | Discrete Choice Modeling | MNL, mixed logit, diagnostics, heterogeneity | Modeling memo |
| 6 | Policy Interpretation & Communication | Scenario building, reporting, visualization | Capstone report & presentation |

## Assessment plan
- 30% Module assignments (Modules 1-5)
- 20% Laboratory/workshop participation
- 20% Peer discussion and critique notes
- 30% Capstone project (Module 6)

Rubrics for each component live inside the [`assignments/`](assignments/01_reflection.md) folder.

## Materials and tools
- *Core texts:* Ben-Akiva & Lerman (1985), Train (2009), Chorus et al. (2020).
- *Survey platforms:* Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, LimeSurvey, Sawtooth (choose based on licensing).
- *Design tools:* Ngene, Lighthouse Studio, `idefix` (R), `pylogit` (Python).
- *Modeling frameworks:* Biogeme (Python), Apollo (R), Statsmodels, scikit-learn (for auxiliary diagnostics).

## Policies & expectations
- **Engagement:** arrive prepared, complete readings before synchronous sessions, and contribute to the collaborative critiques.
- **Ethics:** follow institutional review processes, ensure informed consent, and protect respondent privacy.
- **Collaboration:** brainstorming is encouraged; final submissions should clearly note team members and delineate contributions.
- **Academic integrity:** cite data sources, tools, and literature consistently (APA or IEEE styles recommended).
- **Accessibility:** contact the instructor early for accommodations; all slide decks should follow WCAG-friendly color contrast.

## Support & office hours
Mahbub Hassan hosts weekly office hours (Tuesdays 15:00-17:00 Bangkok time) virtually or in-person on campus. Schedule by email (mahbub.hassan@ieee.org or 6870376421@student.chula.ac.th) at least 24 hours in advance.
