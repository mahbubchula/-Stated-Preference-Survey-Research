# Module 1 - Foundations of Stated Preference Methods

## Overview
Kick off the course by positioning stated preference (SP) techniques within the broader transportation analytics toolbox. This module refreshes discrete utility theory, contrasts SP with revealed preference (RP) data, and reviews high-impact transport case studies that relied on SP evidence.

## Learning objectives
- Explain why SP data is collected when RP data is insufficient or biased.
- Identify the theoretical pillars that support SP experiments (random utility theory, choice axioms).
- Map transport policy questions to appropriate SP survey approaches (contingent valuation, choice experiments, hybrid designs).
- Evaluate the strengths and limitations of seminal SP studies in congestion pricing, microtransit, and EV adoption.

## Session breakdown
### Session 1: RP vs SP landscape
- Mini-lecture: history of travel demand modeling and the rise of SP.
- Activity: break into groups to catalog deficiencies in existing agency datasets.
- Reading discussion: Ben-Akiva & Lerman Chapters 1-2; review Federal Transit Administration SP case note.

### Session 2: Utility theory refresh
- Lecture: random utility models, behavioral assumptions, error terms, independence from irrelevant alternatives.
- Short exercise: derive utility specifications for a three-alternative commuter choice scenario.
- Case study spotlight: Singapore ERP pricing redesign.

## Activities & lab
- **Concept mapping:** Teams create a "decision value chain" poster from planning question -> SP survey -> model -> policy.
- **Tool familiarization:** quick tour of Qualtrics, Ngene, Biogeme dashboards to show full workflow.

## Assignment
[Module 1 Reflection Memo](../assignments/01_reflection.md) - analyze when SP evidence would improve one of your ongoing or hypothetical transport programs.

## Discussion prompts
1. When is RP data preferable even if SP can be fielded cheaply?
2. How can we communicate uncertainty from SP models to decision-makers who expect deterministic forecasts?
