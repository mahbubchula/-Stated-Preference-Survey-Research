# Module 6 - Policy Interpretation & Communication

## Overview
Close the loop by connecting models to decisions. Learners build policy scenarios, assess uncertainty, create stakeholder-ready stories, and deliver a capstone report covering the full SP lifecycle.

## Learning objectives
- Perform scenario analysis using estimated models (price changes, new service alternatives, bundling).
- Quantify willingness-to-pay, adoption forecasts, and sensitivity envelopes for policy levers.
- Communicate uncertainty transparently (confidence intervals, simulation bands, qualitative caveats).
- Craft compelling visuals, dashboards, and executive summaries targeted at transport leadership.

## Session breakdown
### Session 1: Scenario design & simulation
- Lecture: translating coefficients into demand shifts, adoption thresholds, and net benefit calculations.
- Lab: run script-based scenario sweeps (e.g., 100 fare combinations) and export KPIs.
- Case clinic: apply outputs to EV charging network planning and MaaS subscription pricing.

### Session 2: Storytelling & delivery
- Workshop: build an executive storyboard with opening hook, key insights, risks, and recommendations.
- Peer review: teams rehearse presentations, receive structured feedback, and revise final deliverables.
- Panel: invited practitioners comment on policy feasibility and next steps.

## Activities & lab
- **Visualization studio:** create templates in PowerPoint, Flourish, Tableau, or Plotly to highlight trade-offs.
- **Communication plan:** define target audiences, channels, and follow-through actions after report delivery.

## Assignment
[Capstone Project](../assignments/06_capstone.md) - comprehensive submission with methodology report (10-15 pages), modeling appendix, dataset inventory, and presentation deck.

## Discussion prompts
1. How should SP-derived recommendations be positioned alongside RP findings and political realities?
2. What governance structures help ensure SP insights influence procurement, pricing, or service design decisions?

## Recommended resources
- ITF (2021) policy brief on communicating modeling uncertainty.
- Storytelling with Data (Knaflic) - selected chapters for transport use cases.
- World Bank (2022) guidance on integrating SP into economic appraisal.
