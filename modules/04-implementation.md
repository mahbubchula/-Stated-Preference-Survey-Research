# Module 4 - Implementation & Fieldwork

## Overview
Translate design blueprints into live surveys. This module covers instrumentation, pilot testing, metadata capture, sampling logistics, ethics approvals, and data-quality assurance.

## Learning objectives
- Configure online survey tools (Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, LimeSurvey) with advanced logic, randomization, and quotas.
- Build pilot protocols, cognitive interviews, and debugging checklists.
- Develop sampling/recruitment plans with timelines, budgets, and communication scripts.
- Implement data-quality safeguards (timer checks, attention filters, GPS, device metadata).

## Session breakdown
### Session 1: Instrument build & pretesting
- Demonstration: import Module 3 design CSV into Qualtrics; script blocks, randomization, and piping.
- Workshop: teams run live pilots, log issues, and adjust text or timing in real time.
- Lecturette: IRB / ethics frameworks, informed consent examples, and GDPR-style compliance for respondent data.

### Session 2: Field logistics & QA
- Lecture: recruitment vendor selection, intercept vs online, incentive structures.
- Activity: build a fieldwork Gantt chart, risk register, and communication plan.
- Lab: implement automated QA dashboards (Power BI/Excel) to monitor completes, dropouts, and data flags.

## Activities & lab
- **Pilot debrief fishbowl:** one group acts as respondents while others observe and log friction points.
- **Metadata schema:** define naming conventions, version control, and secure storage workflows.

## Assignment
[Module 4 Pilot & Implementation Plan](../assignments/04_pilot_plan.md) - includes survey screenshots, pilot notes, recruiting brief, and QA checklist.

## Discussion prompts
1. How should incentive strategies adapt for hard-to-reach populations (e.g., ride-hail drivers, freight operators)?
2. What data-quality indicators will trigger a pause or redesign in your fieldwork?
