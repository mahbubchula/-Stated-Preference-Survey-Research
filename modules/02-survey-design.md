# Module 2 - Survey Design Essentials

## Overview
Transform policy questions into actionable survey plans. Learners identify target populations, refine research objectives, craft attributes/levels, and storyboard questionnaire flows that minimize respondent burden.

## Learning objectives
- Translate planning problems into measurable SP research objectives.
- Define sampling frames and quotas aligned with policy relevance.
- Draft attributes, levels, and status quo descriptions that resonate with travelers.
- Design survey sections (warm-up, instructional screens, choice sets, debrief) with logical branching.

## Session breakdown
### Session 1: Strategic framing & stakeholder alignment
- Lecture: writing hypotheses, aligning with agency KPIs, scoping constraints (budget, timeline, sample size).
- Workshop: stakeholder interview role-play to extract attribute ideas and adoption barriers.
- Artifact: "Design brief canvas" summarizing decision context, personas, must-have metrics, and success criteria.

### Session 2: Questionnaire architecture
- Lecture: best practices for instructions, comprehension checks, and cognitive load management.
- Demo: compare an effective vs cluttered SP instrument, highlighting transitions and microcopy.
- Exercise: teams sketch a flowchart with question sequencing, piping, and validation rules.

## Activities & lab
- **Attribute selection matrix:** evaluate each candidate attribute using relevance, realism, controllability, and measurability scores.
- **Targeting plan:** build a simple spreadsheet that links recruitment channels with quota targets.

## Assignment
[Module 2 Design Brief](../assignments/02_design_brief.md) - produce an attribute-level table, sample frame, and high-level storyline ready for experimental design.

## Discussion prompts
1. How do cultural norms influence attribute wording or incentive structures?
2. What trade-offs exist between survey length and the richness of attitudinal measures?
