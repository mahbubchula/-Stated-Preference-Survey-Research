<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Duration:</strong> 2 weeks | <strong>Effort:</strong> 10-12 hours | <strong>Level:</strong> Intermediate
</div>

---

## 📋 Overview

Now that you understand the foundations of SP methods, it's time to transform policy questions into actionable survey plans. This module bridges the gap between theory and practice by teaching you how to design surveys that produce reliable, policy-relevant data.

You'll learn to identify target populations, craft meaningful attributes and levels, design questionnaire flows that minimize respondent burden, and align your research objectives with stakeholder needs. By the end of this module, you'll have the skills to create a complete survey design brief ready for experimental design and implementation.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Translate** complex planning problems into measurable SP research objectives with clear success criteria
2. **Define** sampling frames and quota targets aligned with policy relevance and statistical requirements
3. **Develop** attributes, levels, and status quo descriptions that resonate with travelers' real experiences
4. **Design** complete questionnaire architectures including warm-up, instructions, choice sets, and debriefing sections
5. **Apply** cognitive load management techniques to improve response quality and completion rates
6. **Engage** stakeholders effectively to extract attribute ideas and identify adoption barriers

## 🎨 Strategic Survey Design Framework

### The Design Value Chain

Effective SP surveys follow a structured development process:

```
Policy Challenge → Research Questions → Survey Objectives →
Attribute Selection → Level Definition → Questionnaire Architecture →
Pilot Testing → Full Implementation
```

Each step builds on the previous one, creating a coherent path from problem to solution.

### Key Design Principles

| Principle | Description | Impact on Quality |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Relevance** | Attributes match decision-makers' actual levers | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical |
| **Realism** | Scenarios are plausible and relatable | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical |
| **Simplicity** | Cognitive load is minimized | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |
| **Balance** | All perspectives represented fairly | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |
| **Measurability** | Responses can be quantified reliably | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical |
| **Actionability** | Results lead to implementable insights | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical |

---

## 🎯 From Policy Questions to Research Objectives

### Step 1: Problem Framing

Start with a clear policy challenge. For example:

**Policy Challenge:** "Should our city implement dynamic pricing on express lanes?"

**Bad Research Objective:** "Understand traveler preferences for tolling"
- Too vague
- No measurable outcomes
- Unclear decision criteria

**Good Research Objectives:**
1. Estimate willingness-to-pay for 10-minute travel time savings during peak periods
2. Quantify demand elasticity across different income groups
3. Predict mode shift from general lanes to express lanes under three pricing scenarios
4. Identify acceptable price ranges that maintain 80% public support

### Step 2: Stakeholder Mapping

Identify who needs to be consulted and who will use the results:

| Stakeholder Group | Information Needs | Engagement Method |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Decision-makers** | Cost-benefit ratios, political viability | Structured interviews |
| **Operations staff** | Implementation constraints, data availability | Technical workshops |
| **Community groups** | Equity impacts, access concerns | Focus groups |
| **Users (travelers)** | Real-world experiences, pain points | Cognitive interviews |
| **Advocacy organizations** | Environmental/social outcomes | Review panels |

### Step 3: Success Criteria Definition

Define what "good enough" looks like:

**Example Success Criteria:**
- Sample size: n ≥ 1,000 representative commuters
- Precision: Value of time estimated within ±$2/hour (95% CI)
- Timeliness: Results delivered before Q3 budget cycle
- Budget: ≤ $75,000 total survey costs
- Actionability: Clear recommendation for 3 pricing scenarios

---

## 🔍 Attribute Selection: The Heart of Survey Design

### Attribute Selection Matrix

Evaluate each candidate attribute using these criteria:

| Attribute | Relevance | Realism | Controllability | Measurability | Priority |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| Travel time | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Must-have** |
| Cost | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Must-have** |
| Reliability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | **Must-have** |
| Comfort | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Nice-to-have |
| Wi-Fi availability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Optional |

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Relevance:** Does the agency/operator control this attribute?
- **Realism:** Can respondents evaluate it meaningfully?
- **Controllability:** Can it be manipulated in real implementation?
- **Measurability:** Can we observe changes in real-world outcomes?

### Common Attributes by Transport Context

#### Urban Transit Services
- **Frequency:** headway in minutes (5, 10, 15, 20, 30)
- **Fare:** absolute price or relative to current ($2.50, $3.00, $3.50, $4.00)
- **Travel time:** door-to-door minutes
- **Reliability:** percentage on-time performance (85%, 90%, 95%, 98%)
- **Access distance:** walk to stop (200m, 400m, 600m, 800m)
- **Comfort:** crowding level (seats available, standing room, crowded)

#### Road Pricing
- **Toll amount:** dynamic or fixed ($/trip)
- **Time savings:** minutes saved vs. free alternative
- **Reliability:** travel time variability (±2 min, ±5 min, ±10 min)
- **Revenue use:** description of how toll funds are spent
- **Exemptions:** who qualifies for discounts

#### Electric Vehicle Adoption
- **Purchase price:** relative to conventional vehicle (+$0, +$5k, +$10k, +$15k)
- **Range:** miles on single charge (150, 250, 350, 450)
- **Charging time:** fast charge duration (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes)
- **Fuel savings:** annual operating cost reduction
- **Charging infrastructure:** density of charging stations

### Level Definition Best Practices

**Realistic Ranges:**
- Base levels on actual market conditions
- Extend 20-30% beyond current bounds to capture future scenarios
- Avoid unrealistic combinations (e.g., $1 toll with zero time savings)

**Perceptual Thresholds:**
- Use differences respondents can actually perceive
- Time: 5-minute increments for short trips, 10-15 for longer
- Cost: 25-50 cent increments for low-value items
- Distance: 100-200 meter increments for walking

**Example: Transit Fare Study**

```
Current fare: $2.75

Proposed levels:
- Level 1: $2.25 (-18% baseline)
- Level 2: $2.50 (-9% baseline)
- Level 3: $2.75 (status quo)
- Level 4: $3.00 (+9% baseline)
- Level 5: $3.50 (+27% baseline)
```

**Rationale:**
- Symmetric around status quo for unbiased estimation
- 25-cent increments are perceptually meaningful
- Range captures plausible policy debate space
- Five levels allow non-linear preference detection

---

## 👥 Sampling Strategy & Target Populations

### Defining the Sampling Frame

**Questions to Answer:**
1. **Who is the population of interest?**
   - Current users only, or potential users too?
   - Geographic boundaries?
   - Demographic restrictions (e.g., licensed drivers, age 18+)?

2. **What is the required sample size?**
   - Minimum for statistical power (typically n ≥ 300-500)
   - Segmentation needs (n ≥ 100 per subgroup)
   - Budget constraints

3. **How will representativeness be ensured?**
   - Probability sampling vs. quota sampling
   - Weighting strategies for known biases
   - Over-sampling of rare populations

### Sample Size Determination

**Rule of Thumb for MNL Models:**

```
Minimum n = (# of parameters to estimate) × 50

Example:
- 3 alternatives
- 4 attributes per alternative
- 2 alternative-specific constants
Total parameters ≈ 14

Minimum sample: 14 × 50 = 700 observations
If 8 choice tasks per respondent: 700 ÷ 8 ≈ 88 respondents
Recommended: 200-300 respondents for buffer
```

**Advanced Models (Mixed Logit, Latent Class):**
- Multiply base calculation by 1.5 to 2.0
- Account for convergence requirements
- Plan for 20-30% attrition/incomplete surveys

### Quota Design Example

**Transit Redesign Study in Mid-Sized City**

| Segment | Population % | Target n | Recruitment Channel |
|---------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| Daily commuters (drive) | 35% | 350 | Online panel |
| Daily commuters (transit) | 15% | 150 | Intercept at stations |
| Occasional users | 30% | 300 | Social media ads |
| Non-users (interested) | 20% | 200 | Community outreach |
| **Total** | **100%** | **1,000** | Mixed methods |

**Geographic Stratification:**
- Urban core: 40% (n=400)
- Suburban: 45% (n=450)
- Rural fringe: 15% (n=150)

**Socioeconomic Quotas:**
- Income <$50k: 30%
- Income $50k-$100k: 45%
- Income >$100k: 25%

### Section 2: Screening Questions

Efficiently identify qualified respondents:

**Example Screeners for EV Adoption Study:**

1. **Q1:** Do you currently own or lease a vehicle?
   - Yes → Continue
   - No → "Thank you for your interest. This study focuses on current vehicle owners."

2. **Q2:** Are you planning to purchase or lease a vehicle in the next 3 years?
   - Yes → Continue
   - No → "Thank you for participating. We're focusing on near-term vehicle buyers."

3. **Q3:** Which best describes your residence?
   - Own/rent single-family home with driveway/garage → Continue
   - Own/rent apartment with assigned parking → Continue
   - Other → Conditional logic

**Pro Tip:** Place disqualifying questions early to minimize wasted respondent time.

### Section 3: Current Behavior Warm-Up

Build context and prepare respondents for hypothetical scenarios:

**Purpose:**
- Establish reference point (status quo)
- Prime respondents to think about the decision context
- Collect data for pivot designs (personalized scenarios)
- Reduce cognitive load in main experiment

**Example: Commute Context Questions**

```
Think about a typical weekday commute to work or school:

1. What is your usual mode of transportation?
   ☐ Drive alone
   ☐ Carpool
   ☐ Public transit
   ☐ Bike
   ☐ Walk
   ☐ Other: ___________

2. How long does this trip usually take (door-to-door)?
   _______ minutes

3. How much does this trip typically cost you?
   $_______ per trip (or $_______ per month)

4. How reliable is this travel time?
   ☐ Very reliable (±5 minutes)
   ☐ Somewhat reliable (±10 minutes)
   ☐ Unreliable (±15+ minutes)

5. On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with this commute?
   1 (Very dissatisfied) ————————————— 10 (Very satisfied)
```

### Section 4: SP Instructions & Practice Task

**Critical Success Factor:** Ensure comprehension before main experiment

**Instruction Components:**
1. **Context setting:** "Imagine your city is considering..."
2. **Task description:** "You'll see pairs of options and choose your preference"
3. **Attribute explanations:** Define each attribute clearly
4. **Reminder:** "There are no right or wrong answers; choose what YOU would do"
5. **Example task:** Practice with feedback

**Example Instruction Screen:**

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
               CHOICE TASK INSTRUCTIONS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

In the next section, you'll compare different transit service options.

Each option will describe a bus or train trip with different:
  • TRAVEL TIME: door-to-door duration in minutes
  • FARE: one-way ticket price
  • FREQUENCY: typical wait time between vehicles
  • COMFORT: crowding level

For each pair, select which option you would ACTUALLY choose
for your regular commute, even if neither is perfect.

Let's practice with an example...

[Continue to Practice Task]
```

**Practice Task with Feedback:**

After respondent chooses, provide explanatory message:

```
You selected Option A because it has faster travel time and
better comfort, even though it costs more. Great!

In the real tasks, just choose whichever option is best for YOU.
There are no right or wrong answers.

[Ready to Begin]
```

### Section 5: Main Choice Experiment

**Design Considerations:**
- **Number of tasks:** 6-12 per respondent (8 is common)
- **Number of alternatives:** 2-4 per task (2-3 is optimal)
- **Presentation format:** Table, graphical, or narrative
- **Randomization:** Order of tasks and alternatives
- **Progress indicators:** Show completion percentage

**Example Choice Task (Tabular Format):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Choice Task 3 of 8                           [■■■□□□□□] │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Which option would you choose for your commute?        │
├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┤
│                      │   Option A    │    Option B      │
├──────────────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Travel Time          │   35 min      │    42 min        │
│ Fare (one-way)       │   $3.50       │    $2.50         │
│ Typical Wait Time    │   10 min      │    15 min        │
│ Comfort Level        │   Seats available │ Standing room │
├──────────────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ YOUR CHOICE:         │   ☐ Choose A  │    ☐ Choose B   │
└──────────────────────┴───────────────┴──────────────────┘

           ☐ I would not use either option

[< Previous]                              [Next >]
```

**Alternative: Graphical Format**

Use icons, color coding, and visual separators:
- 🚌 for bus, 🚊 for rail
- 💰 for cost, ⏱️ for time
- 🟢 Good, 🟡 Moderate, 🔴 Poor for qualitative attributes

### Section 6: Debriefing & Attitudes

**Example Questions:**

```
1. When making your choices, which factor was MOST important?
   ☐ Travel time
   ☐ Cost
   ☐ Reliability
   ☐ Comfort
   ☐ Other: ___________

2. How realistic were the scenarios presented?
   ☐ Very realistic
   ☐ Somewhat realistic
   ☐ Not very realistic
   ☐ Unrealistic

3. Did you find any scenarios confusing? If yes, please explain:
   _________________________________________________

4. General attitudes (Likert scale 1-5):

   a) "Public transit is a viable option for my regular travel"
      Strongly disagree [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Strongly agree

   b) "I would use transit more if it were faster"
      Strongly disagree [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Strongly agree

   c) "Environmental impact influences my travel choices"
      Strongly disagree [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Strongly agree
```

### Section 7: Demographics

**Standard Variables:**
- Age (categories or continuous)
- Gender identity
- Household income (ranges)
- Education level
- Employment status
- Household size
- Number of vehicles
- Residential location (zip code or neighborhood)

**Privacy Note:** Always explain why demographic data is needed and reassure confidentiality.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications & Case Studies

### Case Study 1: London Congestion Charge Expansion

**Challenge:** Assess public acceptance of extending congestion charging zone

**Survey Design Approach:**
- **Sample:** 3,500 London residents + 1,500 commuters from surrounding areas
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Charge zone boundary (3 options)
  - Price level (£8, £10, £12, £15)
  - Operating hours (7am-7pm vs. 24/7)
  - Exemptions (residents, EVs, taxis)
  - Revenue use (transit, roads, general fund)

**Attribute Development Process:**
1. **Stakeholder workshops** with Transport for London, boroughs, business groups
2. **Focus groups** (8 sessions, n=72) to test attribute wording
3. **Cognitive interviews** (n=24) to validate scenario comprehension
4. **Pilot survey** (n=200) to refine levels

**Key Design Innovation:**
Used **pivot design** where charge levels were personalized relative to respondent's current travel cost, improving realism and engagement.

**Outcomes:**
- Identified £11 as optimal price point balancing revenue and public support
- Discovered strong preference for reinvesting revenue in transit improvements
- Informed 2023 expansion decision

### Case Study 2: Rural Demand-Responsive Transit

**Challenge:** Design on-demand shuttle service for low-density areas

**Survey Design Approach:**
- **Sample:** 800 residents in 3 pilot counties, stratified by:
  - Age (seniors over-sampled)
  - Car ownership
  - Current transit use

- **Key Attributes:**
  - Booking method (phone, app, both)
  - Maximum wait time (15, 30, 45, 60 min)
  - Fare ($2, $4, $6, $8 per trip)
  - Operating hours (peak only, extended, 24/7)
  - Shared ride probability (always private, 50% shared, always shared)

**Attribute Refinement:**
- **Initial plan:** Include vehicle type (van vs. sedan)
- **Focus group feedback:** Respondents didn't care about vehicle; cared about accessibility features
- **Final design:** Replaced "vehicle type" with "wheelchair accessible (yes/no)"

**Survey Flow Innovation:**
Included a **"Current Trip Diary"** before SP tasks:
- Respondents logged 3 recent trips that were difficult without a car
- SP scenarios were framed as alternatives for those specific trips
- Dramatically improved realism scores (from 3.2/5 in pilot to 4.5/5 in main)

**Results:**
- Wait time was 2.5x more important than price
- Strong segmentation by age: seniors valued phone booking much higher
- Service deemed viable if 30-minute max wait could be guaranteed

### Case Study 3: Airline Baggage Fee Unbundling

**Challenge:** Optimize pricing for checked bag, priority boarding, seat selection

**Survey Design Complexity:**
- **Attributes:**
  - Base fare
  - Checked bag fee (1st bag, 2nd bag)
  - Seat selection fee
  - Priority boarding fee
  - Loyalty points earned

**Problem:** Too many attributes (8 total) created cognitive overload

**Solution: Partial Profile Design**
- Each choice task showed only 4-5 attributes
- Attributes rotated across tasks
- More choice tasks (12) to maintain statistical power
- Allowed estimation despite complexity

**Outcome:**
- Successfully estimated willingness-to-pay for all service components
- Identified optimal bundling strategies
- Informed dynamic pricing algorithms

## 💬 Discussion Prompts

**Post your responses on the course forum (200-250 words each; respond to 2 peers):**

### Prompt 1: Cultural Context in Attribute Design

**Question:**
"How should cultural norms and local context influence attribute wording or the design of incentive structures? Provide a specific example from a region or community you're familiar with."

**Discussion Guidelines:**
- Consider language, literacy levels, technology access
- Think about social desirability bias (e.g., environmental attitudes)
- Address trust in government/institutions
- Discuss incentive preferences (cash, vouchers, charity donations)

**Example Starter:**
"In rural areas with limited internet access, phone-based surveys may be preferred, but this constrains the use of visual aids..."

### Prompt 2: Survey Length vs. Depth Trade-off

**Question:**
"What trade-offs exist between survey length and the richness of attitudinal measures? When is it worth adding 5 minutes to capture psychographic data?"

**Consider:**
- Impact on completion rates
- Value of auxiliary information (attitudes, perceptions, lifestyles)
- Sample representativeness vs. sample size
- Budget implications

**Challenge:**
"Defend a position: Either 'Keep it short and simple' OR 'Invest in comprehensive profiling.'"

### Prompt 3: Attribute Overload Dilemma

**Question:**
"You've identified 10 attributes that stakeholders insist are 'all critical.' How do you reduce this to a manageable 5-6 without alienating decision-makers?"

**Approach Strategies:**
- Quantitative prioritization methods
- Phased study design (Study 1 vs. Study 2)
- Partial profile designs
- Post-estimation scenario analysis to address "missing" attributes

**Share:**
A real or hypothetical negotiation process you would use.

## ✅ Module Completion Checklist

Before moving to Module 3, ensure you have:

- [ ] Attended or watched both sessions (8 hours total)
- [ ] Completed attribute selection matrix activity
- [ ] Built a sample recruitment plan
- [ ] Posted to all 3 discussion prompts with peer responses
- [ ] Submitted Module 2 Design Brief
- [ ] Read Dillman et al. (2014) Chapters 4 & 7
- [ ] Read Louviere et al. (2000) Chapters 3-5
- [ ] Reviewed at least one case study in detail (London, Rural DRT, or Airline)

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. **Can you defend your attribute selections** to a skeptical stakeholder using the evaluation matrix?
2. **Can you sketch a complete survey flow** from consent to thank-you page with branching logic?
3. **Can you calculate required sample size** for a basic MNL model with 6 attributes and 3 alternatives?
4. **Can you identify 3 ways to reduce cognitive load** in a complex choice task?

If you answered "yes" to all four—you're ready for Module 3: Experimental Design!
