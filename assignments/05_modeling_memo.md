# Assignment 5 - Modeling Memo

**Linked module:** [Module 5 - Discrete Choice Modeling](../modules/05-modeling.md)

## Objective
Estimate at least two discrete choice models using the pilot or synthetic dataset, compare performance, and translate the results for policy partners.

## Deliverables
1. **Data preparation summary:** dataset lineage, cleaning steps, coding decisions, and final variable dictionary.
2. **Model comparison table:** include at least a base MNL and one advanced model (mixed logit, nested, or latent class) with log-likelihood, AIC/BIC, pseudo-R^2, and key coefficients.
3. **Elasticities & WTP analysis:** compute at least three market-relevant elasticities and willingness-to-pay or value-of-time metrics with interpretation.
4. **Narrative memo (3 pages max):** highlight implications, limitations, and recommended next analyses.
5. **Appendix:** code/notebooks (Jupyter, RMarkdown) with comments sufficient for reproduction.

## Format & submission
- Submit a zipped folder: `M5_modelmemo_<team>.zip`.
- Include README with software versions and instructions to rerun models.
- Provide anonymized data samples if real respondents were used.

## Evaluation rubric
| Criterion | Weight | Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data stewardship | 20% | Clean structure, defensible coding, documentation |
| Modeling rigor | 35% | Correct estimation, diagnostics, comparatives |
| Insightfulness | 30% | Actionable interpretation, policy linkage |
| Communication | 15% | Memo clarity, visuals, professionalism |

## Tips
- Use reproducible scripts with parameters for number of draws and seeds.
- Highlight convergence challenges or sensitivity checks performed.
- Consider including a short video walkthrough (optional) if sharing with busy executives.
