# Assignment 4 - Pilot & Implementation Plan

**Linked module:** [Module 4 - Implementation & Fieldwork](../modules/04-implementation.md)

## Objective
Plan how the SP survey will be programmed, piloted, and deployed while safeguarding data quality and ethics.

## Deliverables
1. **Instrument snapshots:** PDF or PPT showing introduction, one choice task, validation messages, and debrief questions.
2. **Pilot protocol:** schedule, participant criteria (minimum 6 pilots), observation checklist, and revision log.
3. **Recruitment & fieldwork plan:** sampling quotas, outreach scripts, incentive details, vendor coordination, and timeline/Gantt chart.
4. **Quality assurance & ethics memo:** describe consent language, data security plan, monitoring dashboard metrics, and escalation triggers.

## Format & submission
- Consolidate into a single PDF (max 10 pages) with appendices for scripts/schedules.
- Attach spreadsheet or project management exports if helpful.
- File naming: `M4_fieldplan_<team>.pdf`.

## Evaluation rubric
| Criterion | Weight | Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instrument readiness | 25% | Correct logic, clarity, realism |
| Pilot learning loop | 25% | Actionable insights, iteration strategy |
| Operational feasibility | 30% | Timeline, roles, budget realism |
| Ethics & QA | 20% | Consent, privacy, monitoring, contingency plans |

## Tips
- Leverage the QA dashboard template shared in Module 4 labs.
- Document assumptions about vendor SLAs or institutional approvals; unresolved dependencies should be flagged.
