# Assignment 2 - Survey Design Brief

**Linked module:** [Module 2 - Survey Design Essentials](../modules/02-survey-design.md)

## Objective
Produce a professional-grade design brief that will guide experimental design and stakeholder approvals.

## Deliverables
1. **Executive overview (1 page):** planning question, policy stakes, study objectives, and success measures.
2. **Target population & sampling plan:** define personas, quotas, recruitment channels, incentives, and estimated costs.
3. **Attribute-level table:** at least 5 attributes with 3-4 levels each, including status quo and justification notes.
4. **Survey flow diagram:** image or described flow showing warm-up, instructions, comprehension checks, choice tasks, and debrief.

## Format & submission
- Submit as a PDF (max 6 pages) plus optional spreadsheet appendices.
- Provide citations or empirical evidence used to justify attribute levels.
- File naming convention: `M2_designbrief_<team>.pdf`.

## Evaluation rubric
| Criterion | Weight | Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strategic alignment | 25% | Objectives tied to policy outcomes |
| Sampling rigor | 25% | Clear quotas, feasibility, diversity considerations |
| Attribute craftsmanship | 30% | Relevance, realism, measurability, concise descriptions |
| Communication quality | 20% | Visual clarity, flow, stakeholder readability |

## Tips
- Use the provided `Design Brief Canvas` template from Module 2 or adapt your own.
- Run quick cognitive testing with peers before finalizing attribute wording.
- Document open questions for decision-makers; the brief should prompt buy-in.
