# Assignment 3 - Efficient Design Package

**Linked module:** [Module 3 - Experimental Design](../modules/03-experimental-design.md)

## Objective
Generate and defend an efficient choice experiment ready for survey programming.

## Deliverables
1. **Design log:** summary of software used, priors, constraints, blocking strategy, and key settings.
2. **Diagnostics table:** include D-error, S-efficiency, attribute level balance, correlation results, and design size justification.
3. **Sample choice screens:** 2-3 formatted cards showing text, icons, or tables as they will appear to respondents.
4. **Justification memo (1-2 pages):** argue why the design meets research objectives and respondent experience criteria.

## Format & submission
- Provide a zipped folder containing: design CSV, memo (PDF/Markdown), and visuals (PNG/PPTX).
- Use consistent variable naming and include a README for replicability.
- File naming: `M3_designpackage_<team>.zip`.

## Evaluation rubric
| Criterion | Weight | Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical rigor | 35% | Appropriate priors, constraints, diagnostics |
| Respondent experience | 25% | Clarity of choice cards, cognitive load |
| Documentation | 25% | Transparent log, reproducibility, comments |
| Professional polish | 15% | Formatting, adherence to instructions |

## Notes
- If using proprietary tools (Ngene, Sawtooth), export the configuration script or screenshot key settings.
- Teams may compare two candidate designs but must select a final recommendation.
