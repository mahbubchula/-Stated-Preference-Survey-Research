# Capstone Project - Policy Interpretation & Delivery

**Linked module:** [Module 6 - Policy Interpretation](../modules/06-policy-communication.md)

## Objective
Deliver a complete SP research package-from framing through policy recommendations-demonstrating mastery of the entire workflow.

## Components
1. **Technical report (10-15 pages):** executive summary, research objectives, methodology, survey design, implementation insights, modeling results, and policy recommendations.
2. **Modeling appendix:** tables, diagnostics, and sensitivity analyses not included in the main report.
3. **Data inventory:** catalog of datasets produced (survey exports, cleaned files, codebooks) with access notes.
4. **Presentation deck (12-15 slides):** distill the core storyline for decision-makers.
5. **Implementation roadmap:** next steps, resource needs, and potential pilots or policy trials.

## Submission format
- Package everything into `Capstone_<team>.zip`.
- Include a `README.md` describing folder structure, software requirements, and reproduction steps.
- If sharing data externally, use anonymized or synthetic datasets per your IRB/ethics constraints.
