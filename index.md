## Course at a glance
- **Duration:** 6 instructional modules (recommended 6-12 weeks)
- **Delivery:** blended-lectures, workshops, and applied analytics labs
- **Audience:** transportation planners, policy analysts, graduate students
- **Prerequisites:** introductory statistics, familiarity with travel demand concepts, spreadsheet proficiency (Python/R optional)

## What you will learn
1. Compare stated versus revealed preference approaches and understand when SP studies add value.
2. Design coherent survey instruments with defensible attributes, levels, and experimental designs.
3. Deploy SP surveys ethically using pilots, sampling plans, and metadata management.
4. Estimate discrete choice models (MNL, mixed logit, latent class) and interpret elasticities.
5. Translate findings into policy narratives, visualizations, and implementation roadmaps.
